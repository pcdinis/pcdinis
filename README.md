#### Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Paulo and I'm a SAP developer.
I live in Portugal 🇵🇹 and work for one of the best companies ever:
⭐[@DeployKnowledgeConsulting](http://www.deploy.pt)⭐

On my day to day basis i'm  working on the following languages/technologies:
* ABAP
* HANA DB
* Javascript (OpenUI5/SAPUI5)
* HTML
* CSS

But that's not all as I like to explore another stuff within my spare time:
* Unity software: I'm a huge fun of Unity... so just check out on some of my game developer (wannabe 🤓) projects!
* Home Automation: ... using Shelly devices and Google Home! Looking forward to use Shelly scripts new feature! 🏠
* Mastering Rubiks Cube: I'm a 2 minutes solver guy... not a speed cuber! 🧩

Feel free to contact me. 💬

More projects to come... 🚀
